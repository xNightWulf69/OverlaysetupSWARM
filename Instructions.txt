1. run setup.bat and follow all instructions.

2. Open "script.js" with nodepad, notepad ++ or VSCODE,  inside the "RocketLeagueOverlay" folder, Search for CHANGEME and change it to the value you copied.

3. Add "index.html" and "BOSindex.html" to OBS as a local browser source. 1920 width x 1080 height (Place BOSindex.html under Rocket League and palce index.html above Rocket League)

4. Make BOSindex.html not visible, right click it and select "Window projector source" and minimise that window.

5. Select BOSindex.html and click the interact button (This and step 4 make it so you can control the control panel and viewers can't see it.)

6. Start Rocket League, start a private match and select spectator and enjoy. (Might need to refresh index.html and BOS.html on OBS for it to update for the first time.)



Run the "run" file every time you want to use the overlay.
